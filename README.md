# About Me
I am a software developer from The Netherlands. I currently live in the beautiful country in New Zealand and love to code plugins for the spigot community. I have around 5 years of self taught Java experience. Feel free to also checkout one of the video games I created while at university ([Longhaus](https://gendlygames.itch.io/longhaus))
